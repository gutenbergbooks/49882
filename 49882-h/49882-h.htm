<hr class="under_title"/>

<h4 id="Scene_1"><a href="#Scene_1_toc">SCENE I.</a></h4>

<p class="entrance"><i>A Room in</i> C<small>OTTON</small>’<small>S</small> <i>house;—an
open door in</i> <small>C</small>. <i>flat.</i></p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>C<small>OTTON</small>, <i>with a letter.</i></p>

<p>C<small>OT</small>. Provoking! to leave my shop all day for the sake of calling on this
old Wealthington!—that I should be required to call on him!—not but he is a rich relation,
and I have great expectations from him; and my foreman, Bolt, and apprentice Mizzle, are
quite fit persons with whom to entrust my shop. Egad, to make all the naughty apprentices
look on those two young men would be as good a lesson as going to see George Barnwell on a
boxing night!</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> C<small>UTAWAY</small>,
<small>C</small>.&nbsp;<small>D</small>.</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. Hollo! no one in the shop! ha, ha!—(<i>Aside.</i>) Hum, she’s not
here.—Have you anything to sell, old gentleman?</p>

<p>C<small>OT</small>. Of course I have; what do you think I keep a shop for?</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. Ha, ha! right! to be sure—what the devil else <i>should</i> you
keep a shop for?</p>

<p>C<small>OT</small>. (<i>Aside.</i>) Puppy!</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. But, old gentleman! a young lady used to serve in that shop—she is
not ill, I hope?</p>

<p>C<small>OT</small>. No, sir; on the contrary, my daughter is quite well.—Can I do
anything for you in the way of business?</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. (<i>Aside.</i>) Oh! this must be the old father she talks
about.—Ha! you are the commander-in-chief of this concern, hey?</p>

<p>C<small>OT</small>. Probably I am, Mr. Cutaway.</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. Cutaway! you know me, then? What a thing it is to be famous! Know
me, and yet you were never introduced to me, to my knowledge.</p>

<p>C<small>OT</small>. Oh dear no; I used to see you through the <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-2">[Pg 2]</a></span>glass door of my parlour, and I intercepted
certain letters to my daughter. I saw your name, and I inquired into your connexion,—and
saw no reason why I should not—cut the connexion.</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. Very cutting, indeed. He’s a sharp blade. Ha, ha! droll! funny! ha,
ha!</p>

<p>C<small>OT</small>. Happy to find I can please you, sir; I thus return good for evil,
since you by no means please me.</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. Is there any way to please you?</p>

<p>C<small>OT</small>. Oh, certainly; the way to please me lies through yonder door: you
can’t think how prettily that door is painted on the outside. As for my daughter, sir,—I
keep her present abode a secret.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> B<small>OY</small>, <small>L</small>.</p>

<p>B<small>OY</small>. Please, sir, your sister sent me to say that she, with your
daughter, has been obliged to move to No. 19, Moonlight Street, owing to circumstances of
the most peculiar nature.</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. Ha, ha, ha! a most profound secret! Good by, commander-in-chief!
next time you have a secret, mind you don’t tell it by proxy.</p>

<p class="direction_r">(<i>Exit</i>, <small>C</small>.&nbsp;<small>D</small>.)</p>

<p>C<small>OT</small>. Stupid jackanapes! you must open your damned mouth so wide as to
let the cat jump out! (<i>Exit</i> B<small>OY</small>, <small>L</small>.)—A connexion of
which I do not in the least approve;—but—oh, those fellows are at breakfast—Bolt!
Mizzle!</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter</i> B<small>OLT</small> <i>and</i> M<small>IZZLE</small>,
<small>R</small>.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>C<small>OT</small>. Listen!—pressing business obliges me to be absent till late
to-night; I leave the shop to your care.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Thank’e, sir.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. For your confidence, sir.</p>

<p>C<small>OT</small>. Which I know is not misplaced. (B<small>OLT</small><i> and
</i>M<small>IZZLE</small><i> bow.</i>)—On no account leave the premises.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Now, my dear sir, was not that request superfluous?</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Of course, sir, without leave, we should never leave the shop.</p>

<p>C<small>OT</small>. You will excuse my mentioning it, however. All foremen and
apprentices are—alas! not like you. There are several very wicked foremen and apprentices
in the world.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Ah, I have heard so—I have read so—but never met any.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. No; Bolt and I are very particular with whom we associate: evil
communications, you know, sir——</p>

<p>C<small>OT</small>. Right! Very correct, indeed. Robert Mizzle, if you always associate
with such as Charles Bolt, you will doubtless at length reach an elevated post.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. (<i>Aside.</i>) Elevated post! I wonder if he means the
gallows?</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. You flatter me, sir—you flatter me. I discharge my duty, sir,
nothing else;—to be sure, taking care of the morals of this young man——</p>

Good by, Mizzle! Excellent steady creatures! Oh, were all like them, the tragedy of George
Barnwell would never have been written.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Ha, ha, ha! why don’t you laugh, Mizzle?</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Because I don’t see any joke.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Then look at me—I’m a perpetual joke!—I’m all point, like a
porcupine—all fire, like a poet’s heart, and light as his breeches pocket. Old Cotton has
gone out all day—ha, ha! don’t you take? don’t you twig? A’n’t you fly? A’n’t you
awake?</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Yes, I’m awake, but I don’t see.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. We are to mind the shop, are we? I say never mind it—let’s go
out.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Nonsense! you know master and we are like a man and woman in a
weather-house—when one goes out the other stays at home.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. And so, when the old man’s back is turned, we are to shew our
heads are turned, by stopping in the shop all day—selling check’d neck-handkerchiefs and
baby’s red stockings? Not we!—we’ll go out and have some fun, Bobby.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. No, no! it wont do; we must take care of the shop.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Now look ye,—how does master take care of his money?</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. By locking it up.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Then that’s the way we’ll take care of the shop—I’ll lock the
door, and you shall shut the shutters.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Oh, come, come! I sha’n’t go, nor you sha’n’t, either. It wont do,
Charley; better be boxed here, than get in the wrong box.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Well, I’ve made up my mind; the next job is to make up my body: I
must dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Well, you may enjoy your own holiday. Pleasant day, and fine
weather to you, and a prosperous return;—I sha’n’t go.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. You have no grandeur of soul—you don’t love fun.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Come, don’t say that; damn it, I live upon fun—he, he!—you know I
do. Give us your hand, Charley. I’ll go! Oh dear, a day’s pleasure!</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. You’ll go, will you?</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Give us your hand.</p>

yet; but she soon will; she is now so taken up with her ribbons and beautiful purchases,
that she is thinking but little of her beautiful niece.</p>

<p>H<small>AR</small>. But this step—</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. Stands before your prison door—your only step is flight.</p>

<p>H<small>AR</small>. A flight of steps, each one more imprudent than the last. And what
awaits me on my descent?</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. Love, who will be your guide?</p>

<p>H<small>AR</small>. A pretty guide—he is blind himself.</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. True, but there is no resisting him. Love is a <i>torrent</i>—and
his blindness is a <i>cataract</i>. Come, come! the banns have been put up for the last
month, at Croydon Church—the ring is in my waistcoat pocket—I’ve appointed a father to
give you away.</p>

<p>H<small>AR</small>. Father? I haven’t seen him.</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. Probably not, for though <i>a father</i>, he is not yet
<i>apparent</i>. All is right;—away! fly! when they say love is blind, they only mean he
closes his eyes to transgressions like ours.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. No, we have sunk the shop, with a vengeance! Hatchment, the
undertaker, will be calling to know if master’s dead.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Well, but where shall we go?</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. I’m afraid we’ve gone too far already.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Zounds! man, don’t keep watering my spirits in that way; and don’t
pull down the corners of your mouth, and make it look like a horseshoe on its legs. Laugh
at our setting out, at least.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Ha! ha! ha! I will, for I’m thinking there will be devilish little
chance of laughing when we return. Eh—what’s that? (<i>Looking off</i>,
<small>R</small>.<small>H</small>.)</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. What are you staring at now?</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Don’t you see something like an old man?</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Lord bless you, Bobby! it’s the young women I always look at, not
the old men.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. That old man may look at you, notwithstanding. Oh! he draws
nearer.—Oh, the devil! it’s the old gentleman—master, I mean.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Eh, that’s the hat;—his castor’s an unlucky star;—those are his
unmentionables. We’ll turn down the next street.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. But this damned street has no turning for the next quarter of a
mile! Confound it! you must be so fond of enjoying yourself.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. We’ll run.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. (<i>Knocking at door</i>, <small>F</small>.<small>L</small>.) Then
we’ll call on Mrs. Stitchley. Yes, that’s the name on the plate.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. We don’t know her; who the deuce knows Mrs. Stitchley?</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. (<i>Aside.</i>) Ah! that’s the devil of it.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Cause—ah—madam, the cause is the reason, ma’am—Ahem! and the
reason is the cause.—(<i>Aside.</i>) She must have a customer named Smith. You doubtless
know—Miss Smith?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S. No, sir! I have not that honour.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. (<i>Aside.</i>) Of course not; everything goes wrong to-day.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. (<i>Aside.</i>) Smith wont do—I’ll try Brown. Miss Brown, madam,
you know?</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S. Oh dear, yes! Miss Brown is one of my best customers.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Ha! ha! Bobby, the lady and I understand each other now, don’t we?
(<i>Nudges him.</i>)</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S. (<i>Aside.</i>) What odd persons!—Yes, sir; but Miss Brown?</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. True, true! about Miss Brown. There is a little account—</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S. Oh! between me and Miss Brown?—(<i>Aside.</i>) He is a
gentlemanly young fellow, after all.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. I, madam, will settle that account.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. (<i>Aside.</i>) He’ll settle himself if he does; he must be flush

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S. I’ll send my servant for a stamp directly, sir.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Don’t hurry yourself, ma’am; I’ll settle it to-morrow. That’s what
I called for,—to tell you I’d settle it to-morrow.</p>

this may be a prelude to something further.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S. But one thing more. Miss Brown is an intimate friend of mine, as
well as a customer—now I don’t think I ever saw you before!</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Very likely not, ma’am.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. It is exceedingly probable.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. The fact is—ahem!—the facts are these: there is no such person as
Miss Brown; Miss Brown has ceased to be Miss Brown—and I’m a happy man.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. S. What! do you mean that Miss Brown is married, and that you
are—</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Precisely; I see she has not disclosed the tender secret.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. (<i>Aside.</i>) Ha, ha! it is funny, after all.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Miss Brown, you see, is now Mrs. Steele. Yes—my name is Steele,

yourselves.</p>

<p>M<small>ISS</small> B. (<i>Aside.</i>) It may be an eccentric method of making an
offer. He is not bad looking, and opportunities are—alas!—not too frequent. I’ll humour
it.—And so my dear Steele’s confess’d?</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Ha, ha, ha! Yes.—(<i>Aside.</i>) Dear Steele! She jumps at it.—I’m
magnetic steel. (<i>Whisper.</i>) I say, what’s the meaning of this?</p>

nothing.</p>

sovereigns.</p>

Something false, as usual? The lady loves the marvellous.—No, hope reminds me that Harriet

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Miss Harriet Cotton, according to the letter I read to you, must
soon be here. Heigho! a persecuted being, like I was at seventeen.</p>

<p>B<small>RIDG</small>. La, ma’am!</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Yes, her love is disapproved of, and she is sent here to be far
from the object of her affections. Heigho! just my case.</p>

<p>B<small>RIDG</small>. Why, ma’am, I thought the object of your affections ran away from
you.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Ahem! It might be so; but, however, Bridget, it came to just the
same thing in the end. My fate teaches <i>me</i> mercy. I am determined to shew every
kindness to this Harriet, though my letter tells me that Mr. Cutaway is dauntless in
pursuing her;—just my case.</p>

<p>B<small>RIDG</small>. On the contrary, ma’am, your admirer seems to have been dauntless
in pursuing the opposite direction.</p>

<p>M<small>RS</small>. C. Well, I will just go and adjust my head-dress. You will shew the
young lady every attention if she should arrive meanwhile. Heigho! I dare say her delicate
heart is in a fine state of palpitation. Just my case.</p>

of the water-butt;—do not, star as you are, set in the ocean. (M<small>IZZLE</small>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Stay, my bundle! oh, my bundle!</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. What bundle, sweetest?</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. A bundle I have left; so do you bundle up the ladder and get
it.</p>

<p>C<small>UT</small>. Your desires are commands, lovely one.—She is hoarse;—caught cold,
poor thing. (<i>Ascends ladder and goes in at window.</i>)</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. I say, Bob, what did you send him in there for?</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Why the cursed officers are breaking open the door. I heard them;
so I gave him for a sop—Ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Ha! ha! ha! poor devil! Now away with the ladder to the garden
wall. (M<small>IZZLE</small> <i>plants ladder against wall</i>, <small>L</small>.) Now
we’ll ascend, and drop on the other side.</p>

<p class="entrance"><i>Enter </i>B<small>OLT</small><i> and</i> M<small>IZZLE</small>.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Yes, you may ha! ha! ha!—but I don’t see anything to ha! ha! at—No,
nor to ho! ho! at neither. I have done with fun for ever.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Oh! don’t say so! we are all right, you know. Have not I got
through beautifully? steered through all the windings and intricacies? Do you suppose a
skilful coachman would give a fig for a drive on a smooth road?—No! it is turning the
sharp corners that displays ingenuity.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Ah! but don’t let me be on the box with the said ingenious
coachman.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. To be sure it was lucky we overtook young Rattle, with his gig;—if
he had not given us a lift, we should not have been home till breakfast time.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. No!—and master would. A pretty figure we should have cut, if we’d
arrived in time to find him opening the shutters.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Well! we’ll go in. (<i>Feels in his pocket.</i>) Here is the
key—No! curse it, there is not!—nor in this pocket!—nor in that!—Bobby, did I give you the
key?</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. No! (<i>feeling.</i>) No—I have not got it!</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. The deuce! then we have—</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. No! you are not going to say the key is lost? don’t say so!</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. It is though, whether I say so or not; and now I remember, I heard
something chink on the ground, when I jumped off the wall.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Oh! what a devil of a chink that was!</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. It’s confoundedly awkward!</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. <i>It</i> is? I like that! <i>you</i> were confoundedly awkward,
you mean. Why did not you do as I do when I carry money? put it in my breeches pocket, and
tie pack-thread round.</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Ha! ha! ha! Don’t be down-hearted Bobby—here is a third
adventure;—it will have an end. But give me time, my boy, and I’ll get through
anything.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Then if you could get through that keyhole, it <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-21">[Pg 21]</a></span>would be the best
exercise for your ingenuity. (<i>Rain heard.</i>) ’Gad it is coming on to rain like the
very deuce!</p>

<p>B<small>OLT</small>. Here is a shelter; we’ll get in here.</p>

<p>M<small>IZ</small>. Yes! and we shall soon have the pleasure of seeing Old Cotton let
himself in. Crikey! what a well-spent day!</p>

<p>N<small>EW</small>. And you left this same old Cotton?</p>

<p>P<small>RIG</small>. He made me leave, on account of a little exercise of my ingenuity.
But you see I was down upon him.</p>

<p>N<small>EW</small>. What by taking the impression of the street-door key in wax?—But
why the devil did you not go in before?</p>

<p>P<small>RIG</small>. Cos I had not the pluck; when I met with you, I was inspired.</p>

<p>This transcription is based on images digitized from a microform copy made available by
the University of California, Davis. These images have been posted on the Internet Archive
at:</p>

<p class="center"><a href="https://archive.org/details/OxenfordDayWellSpent">
archive.org/details/OxenfordDayWellSpent</a></p>

<p>In general, this transcription attempts to retain the formatting, punctuation and
spelling of the source text, including variant spellings such as “good by” and “wont”
(instead of “won’t”). In a few cases where the quality of the images made a word or a
punctuation mark hard to read, the obvious reading was considered the correct reading
without comment.</p>

<p>The following changes were made:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cover and title page: Changed “Day Well Spent” to “A Day Well Spent.” The original
title page gives the title as “Day Well Spent.” On the first page of the text and in the
running title throughout, the title is “A Day Well Spent.”</li>

<li>p. 5: C<small>OTTON</small> <i>runs across from</i> R. <i>to</i> L.—Added a closing
parenthesis at the end of the stage direction for consistency.</li>

<li>p. 8: B<small>OLT</small>. Ha, ha, ha! Yes.—(<i>Aside</i>) Dear Steele! She jumps at
it.—I’m magnetic steel. (<i>Whisper</i>)—Inserted a period after “<i>Aside</i>” and
“<i>Whisper</i>”.</li>

<li>p. 9: <i>A Room at an Inn—A window open, with balcony, a little to
the</i> <small>R</small>. <i>in flat,—A large screen</i>—Deleted the comma after
“<i>flat</i>”.</li>

<li>p. 10: (<i>Whispers</i>) I’ll tell you what we must do, Bobby,—Inserted a period after
“<i>Whispers</i>”.</li>

<li>p. 12: <i>Makes signs to</i> B<small>OLT</small><i>—slips</i> M<small>ISS</small>
B<small>ROWN</small>’<small>S</small> <i>cloak and bonnet offchair</i>—Changed
“<i>offchair</i>” to “<i>off chair</i>”.</li>

<li>p. 12: I have it, Mr Cotton has a foreman named Bolt—Added a period after “Mr” for
consistency.</li>

<li>p. 18: (<i>Exeunt </i>M<small>ISS</small> B. and M<small>RS</small>. S.
